  <h2> 16:198:598: Learning in Humans and Machines, Spring 2022, Rutgers</h2>
<p> This interdisciplinary seminar course explores the parallels between human learning and machine learning. The central link between the two is the set of shared computational problems faced by humans and machines which includes making complex decisions; predicting future events; storing and retrieving information efficiently; and generalizing knowledge to new situations. By examining such problems, we will see that 1) solutions drawn on methods developed from machine learning can help us gain insights about human cognition, and conversely, 2) knowledge about how humans solve these problems can inform the development of more intelligent machines <a
