  <p> I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to mentor and to help students grow, as my own academic trajectory has been shaped by great mentors.
My training as a cognitive neuroscientist and computer scientist has provided me with a foundation in experimental and technical topics, and a perspective
  to work with students from diverse academic majors, whether it is psychology, neuroscience, math or computer science.
  <!-- I adjust my mentoring style, being more hands-on or more hands-off, according to the independence level and stages of the students.
  I support students every step of the way, whether it is to keep basic research rountines with email corerspondences and weekly meetings,
  give general career advice outside the research project, or continue supporting students with reference letters whether they are going to academia or industrial afterwards.
  I hope the time students spent working with me will help them grow passion about research, and develop transferable real-life problem solving skills.--></p>

<p><!-- Here is a list of current and past students I mentored: Somya Arora, Arjun Devraj, Mariah Lutchman, Zach Paris, Stephen Plocyn, Eno Reyes, Samarie Wilson.-->
Please find details on my ongoing and past projects <a
