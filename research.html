		<h2>Rational models of memory </h2>
	    <p> How to best encode and represent information and later efficiently retrieve them is a challenging computational problem.
        I analyze these aspects of human memory system by comparing human behavior to optimal or rational solutions to such computational problems. </p>

		<h2>The influence of prior knowledge on learning and memory</h2>
    <p> </p>
	    <p>How we learn new information is constanyly shaped by our prior knowledge. I study how our prior knowledge serves as a scaffold where new memories bind to,
      and how this scaffold can faciliate more efficient search over memories. </p>

		<h2>Information processing in the brain</h2>
	     <p> Visual processing, memory retrieval, decision making are hidden cognitive processes that are not directly observable from behavioral responses.
         I develop machine learning methods that allow us to track when and where these hidden cognitive process occurs in the brain, using a combination of
       neural imaging techniques (EEG, MEG, ECoG).   </p>

		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Hippocampus-cortical interactions in working memory retrieval</h3>
	    <p>The interactions between the hippocampus and the neocortex are central to a lot of learning and memory processes. In this study, we have With the spatial resolution of ECoG, and the application of the HSMM-MVPA approach to capture the brief moment of memory retrieval in each trial,  </p>

</section>

	    <p>First, we aim to identify when the key cognitive processes (e.g. memory retrieval, decision making) of such tasks take place in a trial. This is a challenging question given that they occur at different times across different trials. Instead of averaging over all trials to obtain a single marker of where an important cognitive event occur (e.g. event-related potential analysis), we developed a procedure to apply a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) to parse each trial into the same sequence of stages, thus characterizing when a particular cognitive process takes place on a trial-by-trial basis [1]. </p>
	    <p>Second, combined with the timing information of when certain cognitive events occur, we aim to identify what brain regions contribute to a particular cognitive stage/process. To utilize different trade-offs in spatial/temporal resolution across different imaging modalities, we have applied the HSMM procedure to EEG[1,2,4], MEG[5] and combined EEG/ECoG datasets[3] of similar memory tasks, and observed converging results of the underlying memory processes.</p>


	    Memories are not stored independently in the brain: they often interfere with each other when it comes to the moment of retrieval. To understand the source of such interference, I examine the impact of different experimental factors on the speed of memory retrieval. Human bran is like a computer, that it receives input, processes information, and delivers output

	    To understand source of such interference, I examine the time course and the neural correlates of memory retriea

	     To better understand why retrieval is sometimes more effortful than other times, I study how memories interact by combining brain imaging data with cognitive models.

	     To be able to recall if we have encountered something before, we need to retrieve a specific related piece of memory.
	    The majority of my PhD efforts focus on uncovering the cognitive stages (i.e. information processing stages) involved in completing a variety of memory tasks. Such tasks include deciding whether one has seen an item before (i.e. a simple recognition task), or whether one has seen a pair of items together before (i.e. an associative recognition task). The items/pairs of items have been memorized either hours in advance (i.e. long-term memory), or seconds in advance (i.e. short-term memory).  </p>

	    <p> Last but not the least, the methods we have developed are useful to a wide range of scenarios, in addition to examining memory tasks. In the past, reaction times are used as the only measure of information processing speed. However, we have demonstrated a case where an experimental factor increases the time duration in one stage but decreases the time duration in another stage. Therefore, being the sum of all stages in a task, reaction times are less informative [2]. We have also demonstrated that after inserting an extra cognitive stage in the task, using reaction times is not able to identify changes in existing cognitive stages whereas the HSMM procedure is able to [4]. </p>
