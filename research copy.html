		<h2>Rational models of memory </h2>
	    <p> My primary research interests lie in the urge to understand, not only what we observe about human memory, but also the reasons behind those observations.
        For example, forgetting in human memory has been observed in scientific studies from as early as 1885, but it is only in 1990 that we understand the reason behind forgetting:
        there is no need to continue storing information that becomes less and less relevant in the current envirnoment. I apply similar rational approaches to my research to undertand,
        not only what the human beahvior is in a given task, but most importantly what the optimal behavior is given the computational problem imposed by the memory task.
        These efforts will serve as a way to translate assumptions about peopleâ€™s goals and the structure of the memory environment into predictions about human behavior that we can test in empirical studies. </p>

      <p> Psychologists have studied the rich behavioral patterns in free recall task for decades, however, it remains unclear why certain types of recall organization might be favored in the first place.
        In a recent project [1], we provide a rational analysis of the free recall task, deriving the optimal policy for recalling items under the internal representations and processes described by
        a mechanistic model that has been shown to capture memory search behavior. We show that the optimal policy for free recall is to start from the beginning of the list and then sequentially recall forwards,
        providing a rational account of the primacy and forward asymmetry effects typically observed in free recall.</p>

      <p> In two undergraduate projects where I played the mentoring role [2-3], we showed that the extent that human categorization relies more on prototype representations or examplar representations depends on
      how accessible those representations are in their memory given the environmental statistics, consistent with a rational account [2]. In another project, we provided a Bayesian model on hindsight bias,
    where memory of an original event is biased towards post-event information. Moreover, we showed that the amount of bias depends on plausibility of the post-event information. This model provides a rational account of hindsight bias by considering memory recall as a statistical problem, where the goal is
    to reconstruct the original estimate using new evidence [3]. </p>

     <p> Once we understand how people optimally encode and recall information under cognitive constraints and the environment, we can alleviate the cognitive constraints and alter the environment to further
       boost their memory performance. This line of work has close connection with mnemonic techniques and AI assistants, which is the focus of several of my ongoing projects [5-7]. Ask me more about them!  </p>

		<h2>The influence of prior knowledge on learning and memory</h2>
    <p> </p>
	    <p>Studies have shown that the way that new information is absorbed is constanyly shaped by our prior knowledge. To extend this, we examine how our prior knowledge can affect not only learning new information itself,
         but also the way it is generalized later [1]. In another study, we demonstrate that prior knowledge affects whether episodic associations are encoded in a holistic representation or separate directional
         representations [2]. In an ongoing project, we examine how prior knowledge influences the temporal dynamics and recall performance during memory search [3]. </p>

		<h2> Neuroimaging methods</h2>
	<p> The human brain functions by receiving an input, processesing information, and producing an output. To be able to isolate the cognitive process of interest from this cascade of events, we develope a method that can parse neural time series data into a sequence of latent cognitive stages [1]. In this way, we can model the trial-to-trial variability of when a cognitive process takes place. </p>


<p> Pooling neural imaging data across subjects requires aligning
     recordings from different subjects. We investigate a method that bypasses
     source-localization in aligning MEG subjects [2]. It transforms individual
     subject data to a low-dimensional common representational space where
     inter-subject consistency is maximized. We evaluate the robustness of this
     approach over both a synthetic dataset and an MEG dataset. </p>

		<h2>Human memory and information processing</h2>
	     <p> Psychological research has long sought to characterize mental processes (i.e. information processing stages) that give rise to observable behavior. In the past, by combining neural imaging data and cognitive modeling approaches, we have identified the sequences of mental stages underlying associative recognition task, working memory task, and memory-based arithmetic task. In particular, we have demonstrated: </p>


	    <p><i>The effect of inserting an additional mental process</i>. Imagine that you are solving a math multiplication problem: in scenario 1, the calculation is based on numerical values only (e.g. 3 x 5); scenario 2 is exactly the same calculation as scenario 1, but some numerical values are replaced with symbols (e.g. 3 x C, where C = 5). We identified in this EEG study that, the additional efforts you put in the scenario 2 is more than just replacing C with 5 in your mind [1]. There is interference with the existing mental process when inserting an additional mental process.

		<p> This result also gives additional implication on the methodology side.  In the fMRI literature, one often identifies neural correlates of a cognitive process by contrasting brain activation when the process is present versus absent. We demonstrated a scenario when this approach does not hold, with the inserted mental process interacting with the existing ones.</p>

	    <p> <i>A detailed mapping of working memory retrieval in space and in time</i>. Subjects memorized a list of faces, and were asked immediately afterwards, if a presented face was in the previously memorized set. Combining the temporal and spatial resolution in EEG and ECoG data of the same task, we identified early neural components that are consistent with visual encoding, followed by familiarity signal in the temporal cortex; once the memorized face set is activated, frontal cortex guides the decision by theta coupling with medial temporal lobe [2].

	    <p> <i>The effect of similarity on recognition memory</i>. Think of when you're on a bus: the more a stranger looks similar to a friend that you knows, the more likely you would recognize her/him as your friend. In this EEG study, we identified a complex pattern of how such similarity affects different cognitive processes. Namely, the more similar the stranger is to your friend, the easier it is to recall your friend (i.e. faster retrieval), but the more difficult it is to decide he/she is not your friend (i.e. slower decision) [3]. </p>

		<p> There is an additional implication of this result on the methodology side. In the psychology literature, overall response times are often used to infer the speed of individual cognitive processes. We demonstrated a scenario where one experimental factor (i.e. similarity) can speed up one cognitive process but slow down another, making it difficult to identify their changes by observing response times alone. The method we developed to parse the neural data into a sequence of latent stages is particularly useful in this scenario. </p>

	    <p>The interactions between the hippocampus and the neocortex are central to a lot of learning and memory processes. In this study, we have With the spatial resolution of ECoG, and the application of the HSMM-MVPA approach to capture the brief moment of memory retrieval in each trial,  </p>

</section>

	    <p>First, we aim to identify when the key cognitive processes (e.g. memory retrieval, decision making) of such tasks take place in a trial. This is a challenging question given that they occur at different times across different trials. Instead of averaging over all trials to obtain a single marker of where an important cognitive event occur (e.g. event-related potential analysis), we developed a procedure to apply a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) to parse each trial into the same sequence of stages, thus characterizing when a particular cognitive process takes place on a trial-by-trial basis [1]. </p>
	    <p>Second, combined with the timing information of when certain cognitive events occur, we aim to identify what brain regions contribute to a particular cognitive stage/process. To utilize different trade-offs in spatial/temporal resolution across different imaging modalities, we have applied the HSMM procedure to EEG[1,2,4], MEG[5] and combined EEG/ECoG datasets[3] of similar memory tasks, and observed converging results of the underlying memory processes.</p>


	    Memories are not stored independently in the brain: they often interfere with each other when it comes to the moment of retrieval. To understand the source of such interference, I examine the impact of different experimental factors on the speed of memory retrieval. Human bran is like a computer, that it receives input, processes information, and delivers output

	    To understand source of such interference, I examine the time course and the neural correlates of memory retriea

	     To better understand why retrieval is sometimes more effortful than other times, I study how memories interact by combining brain imaging data with cognitive models.

	     To be able to recall if we have encountered something before, we need to retrieve a specific related piece of memory.
	    The majority of my PhD efforts focus on uncovering the cognitive stages (i.e. information processing stages) involved in completing a variety of memory tasks. Such tasks include deciding whether one has seen an item before (i.e. a simple recognition task), or whether one has seen a pair of items together before (i.e. an associative recognition task). The items/pairs of items have been memorized either hours in advance (i.e. long-term memory), or seconds in advance (i.e. short-term memory).  </p>
	    <p>First, we aim to identify when the key cognitive processes (e.g. memory retrieval, decision making) of such tasks take place in a trial. This is a challenging question given that they occur at different times across different trials.

	    <p> Last but not the least, the methods we have developed are useful to a wide range of scenarios, in addition to examining memory tasks. In the past, reaction times are used as the only measure of information processing speed. However, we have demonstrated a case where an experimental factor increases the time duration in one stage but decreases the time duration in another stage. Therefore, being the sum of all stages in a task, reaction times are less informative [2]. We have also demonstrated that after inserting an extra cognitive stage in the task, using reaction times is not able to identify changes in existing cognitive stages whereas the HSMM procedure is able to [4]. </p>

    <h2> Transfer of learning</h2>
      <p> Human can complete a wide variety of tasks well in life, not because they have the opportunities to learn each of them one by one, but that human is capable of transferring old knowledge to new situations. In this project, I examined how students are able to extend their previous problem solving skills to new but similar problems, and found neural signature that account for individual differences in the task performance. Over fMRI data, subjects who perceive different problems similarly (i.e. who show consistent and stable brain patterns both within-subject and across-subjects) perform better. The level of consistency at the beginning of the experiment is also predictive of their later performance. </p>

		<h2> Brain computer interface</h2>
      <p> In my undergraduate project during the time at UCSD, I tried to
      improve brain-computer interface (BCI) systems by incorporating the effect
      of feedback. BCI requires accurate classification of brain signal before
      sending control to an external device. There is continuous feedback to the
      BCI user whether such control is successful. User's response to the
      feedback has been shown in general to be a source of noise that can add to
      the non-stationarity of the brain signal; however, in this work, we show
      that the user's brain response to the feedback can be used to improve the
      BCI performance. </p>
